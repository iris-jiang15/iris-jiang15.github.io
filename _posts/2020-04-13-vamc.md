In Winter 2020, I worked with [Prof. Ben Feng](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mbfeng/) as a part-time Undergraduate Research Assistant. The research project focused on Monte Carlo methods for the valuation of variable annuities. We developed and updated an R package [`vamc`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vamc) for
